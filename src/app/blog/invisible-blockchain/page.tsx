            Crypto, DeFi, Web3, Blockchain, Smart Contracts, Wallets, Gas Fees, Private Keys,
            Consensus Mechanisms, Liquidity Pools, all these junky words move your users away. They
            create unnecessary barriers between people and the financial services they need.
          </p>

          <p>
            When my friend needs to pay me back for lunch, they don't care about the "revolutionary
            technology" behind PIX. They just want their money to go from point A to point B without
            a headache.
          </p>

          <p>
            The crypto world is basically saying "learn our weird language or you can't sit with
            us." It's like those exclusive clubs with secret handshakes that nobody actually wants
            to join. No wonder most people aren't rushing to use these apps!
          </p>

          <p>
            Web3 shouldn't be a barrier but about building blocks. We should be able to snap these
            financial tools together without needing a PhD in cryptography first.

            <p>
              I once tried to get my mom to send me some Bitcoin while I was traveling. It was a
              disaster. I told her to use my old notebook where my Electrum wallet was stored
              offline. First, she needed to turn on the notebook. Then login to the wallet. Then she
              had to download Blue Wallet on her phone and import the extended pub key to see the
              funds. Then click on send, select the amount, and scan the QR code from the offline
              notebook. After that, she needed to sign the transaction, grab a pendrive, transfer
              the signed transaction to it, and finally broadcast it.
            </p>

            <p>
              She gave up after 5 minutes and just sent me money through the bankâ€¦ which took three
              days and cost $15 in fees.
            </p>

            <p>That's when it hit me: if my mom can't use it, it's not ready for the world.</p>

            <p>
              This should be the real benchmark for crypto apps, not approval from crypto Twitter or
              praise from blockchain developers. Can someone who has zero interest in the technology
              still benefit from it? That's the only question that matters.

              Remember when touchscreens were cutting-edge technology? Now toddlers swipe phones
              before they can talk. QR codes went from weird marketing tricks to how millions of
              Brazilians pay for everything with PIX every day.

              In Latin America, we have amazing regional payment systems like PIX in Brazil and SPEI
              in Mexico. They're fast and convenient, but only within their own countries. Try
              sending money between them and suddenly you're back to high fees, long waits, and
              endless questions about "the purpose of your transaction"

              This isn't just annoying, it has real consequences. It means small businesses can't
              easily expand across borders. It means families pay ridiculous fees to support
              relatives in other countries. It means opportunities are limited by geography

              To my fellow young developers: let's be the generation that builds technology that
              solves real problems instead of creating new ones. Let's focus on making things that
              work for everyone, not just the few tech bros

            <p>
              The builders who will win aren't the ones who can explain the most complex blockchain
              concepts. They're the ones who can hide that complexity entirely while delivering real
              benefits to real people

              I predict that within 5 years, the most successful "crypto" apps won't mention crypto
              at all. They'll just be the apps that send money faster, cheaper, and more reliably
              than anything else
            </p>

            <p>
              And that's how we'll know the technology has truly succeeded, not when everyone is
              talking about it, but when no one needs to
